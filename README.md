## Introduction

I've got this idea by searching in my room for something I used to play with when I was young... and I found a easy Rubiks cube which was in 3x3

I wanted to make it possible to play with one virtually. So I came up with the idea of using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) for this project because I already had some experience with it in the past with my other Open-Source project [cosmic-adventure](https://github.com/LelouchFR/cosmic-adventure).
